###  Integrated analyses of GHG emission estimates and extreme weather events using airborne trace gas measurements, satellite observations, and models
The ability to obtain accurate emission estimates of greenhouse gases (GHGs) has been
highlighted as an important issue for many decades, not only for regulating local air quality
but also for assessing national-scale air quality and climate concerns. In particular, urban
emissions need to be well-understood because approximately 70% of anthropogenic
greenhouse gas emissions originate from urban areas. Emission of carbon dioxide (CO2)
and methane (CH4) and the meteorological factors affecting them using an aircraft
equipped with a cavity ring-down greenhouse gas sensor as part of the Alpha Jet
Atmospheric eXperiment (AJAX) project flights in a cylindrical pattern was estimated over
Sacramento, California. To better constrain the emission fluxes, we designed flights in a
cylindrical pattern and computed the emission fluxes from two flights using a kriging
method and Gaussâ€™s divergence theorem. Differences in wind treatment and assumptions
about background concentrations affect the emission estimates by a factor of 1.5 to 7.
The uncertainty is also impacted by meteorological conditions and distance from the
emission sources. The total flux estimates accounting for the entire circumference are
larger than those based solely on measurements made in the downwind region. This
indicates that a closed-shape flight profile can better contain total emissions relative to a
one-sided curtain flight because most cities have more than a point source and wind
direction can change with time and altitude. To reduce the uncertainty of the emission
estimate, it is important that the sampling strategy account not only for known source
locations but also possible unidentified sources around the city.
Other than CO2 and CH4 emission estimates study, the recent studies regarding
long-range ozone transport and extreme precipitation events (e.g. atmospheric rivers) are
also briefly introduced.
