### Supporting Urban Air Mobility Operations with Building-Resolving Simulations: Weather Sensitivities of Fine-Scale Urban Flows
The recent emergence of unmanned aerial system (UAS) and urban air mobility (UAM), the new
frontiers in air transportation operating in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), is expanding
the scope of aviation turbulence forecasting system from ensemble-mean to eddy-resolving
forecasts (Muñoz-Esparza et al. 2018). Despite its tangible benefits, operational turbulence-
resolving forecasting at scales of 10-100 m is not quite feasible yet due to its high computational
costs, and resolving urban landscapes at scales of 1 m for UAM applications poses additional
challenges. This study investigates the impact of urban landscapes on low-level turbulence and
associated turbulence hazards to UAM operations, based on ideal- and real-case building-
resolving simulations using the GPU-accelerated FastEddy® large-eddy simulation (LES) model
(Sauer and Muñoz-Esparza 2020) with explicit representation of building effects by an immersed
body force method (Muñoz-Esparza et al. 2020).

We first explore the interactions between urban landscapes and ABLs, using idealized building-
resolving LESs of the flow around isolated cuboid buildings to variations in the incoming
turbulence arising from changes in ABL stability. 21 building-resolving simulations are
performed under varying ABL stability conditions, from weakly stable to convective ABLs, and
for different building sizes (H), resulting in L<sub>ABL</sub> /H &asymp; 0.1 – 10, where L<sub>ABL</sub> is the integral length
scale of the incoming ABL turbulence. The building-induced flow features observed in the
canonical neutral ABL simulation, e.g., the upstream horseshoe vortex and the downstream arch
vortex, gradually weaken with increasing surface-driven convective instability due to the
enhancement of background turbulent mixing. By considering the ABL turbulence scale and
building size altogether, it is shown that the building impact on the surrounding flow decreases
with increasing L<sub>ABL</sub> /H, as coherent turbulent structures (e.g., near-surface streaks, convective
rolls and open cells) in the ABL become more dominant over building-induced flow response for
L<sub>ABL</sub> /H &gt; 1.

We further extend our analysis on the interactions between urban landscapes and ABLs by
performing building-resolving simulations over the realistic urban topography of downtown
Dallas, TX, USA. The realistic three-dimensional building information is generated from Dallas
Lidar dataset and building footprints, provided by the Texas Natural Resource Information
System and the City of Dallas GIS Department, respectively. The weather dataset, which
provides the ABL forcing conditions to building-resolving LESs, is generated from a series of
48-hour weather forecasts centered at downtown Dallas using the Weather Research and
Forecasting model. Typical weather scenarios of the downtown Dallas region at 06, 09, 12, 15
and 18 LT for January and July are examined to investigate how local weather patterns that vary
seasonally and diurnally modify low-level wind and turbulence in the urban environment, and
impact UAM operations including turbulence hazards during landings and takeoffs.
