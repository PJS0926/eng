### New approach for estimating soil moisture and soil organic matter from microwave brightness temperature
Various climate (i.e., oceanic and atmospheric) variability modes with interannual timescales are co-
existed around the Pacific Ocean. In the tropics, the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) which is
characterized by the strongest interannual variability in the world exists. For the subtropical North
Pacific, the Pacific Meridional Mode (PMM) which is another ocean-atmospheric coupled variability
mode evolves, in association with the Pacific Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). For the
midlatitudes, the Aleutian Low (AL) and the North Pacific Oscillation (NPO) reside together, which
are primary atmospheric modes, featured as a monopole and a meridional dipole of sea level pressure
anomaly, respectively.

It is known that the Pacific climate variability modes interact spatiotemporally. When a positive phase
ENSO (i.e., El Nino) occurs in boreal winter, it accompanies stationary Rossby waves propagating
midlatitudes. Simultaneously, the AL tends to intensify as moving toward the North America. Then,
the intensified AL modulates underlying North Pacific condition and weather/climate over the East
Asia to the North America (vice versa for La Nina).

Also, the climate variability in the midlatitudes is able to affect tropical climate. The positive phase
NPO (north anticyclonic-south cyclonic flows) in boreal winter induces low-level westerly wind
anomaly in the subtropical North Pacific. Interacting with the climatological mean trade wind, the
low-level zonal wind anomaly induces anomalous sea surface temperature warming by reduced latent
heat flux, which develops into an El Nino event in the following winter (vice versa for negative phase
NPO). Additionally, the PMM in the subtropics in boreal spring is reported to trigger following ENSO
events.

In the seminar, recent findings regarding tropics-extratropics connection in the Pacific Ocean will be
addressed based on the analysis of the CMIP models and the observational reanalysis dataset.
