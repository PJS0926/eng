### Stratospheric-Tropospheric interaction and its application: Stratospheric sudden warming events
Stratospheric sudden warming (SSW) events are one of the most remarkable examples of
subseasonal variability in the boreal-winter stratosphere. These events are driven by
vertically-propagating planetary-scale waves from the upper troposphere, but also
significantly impact on the tropospheric circulation through stratosphere-troposphere
dynamical coupling. The downward influence is often maintained for up to two months in
the northern extratropics. The SSW events also exhibit pronounced interannual variability,
related to El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the troposphere and quasi-biennial
oscillation (QBO) in the stratosphere. The SSW events occur more favorably during El
Niño and easterly-phase QBO winters. Due to the long-lasting impact on the
troposphere and the relationship with the interannual variability, the SSW events have
been regarded as an important source for subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) prediction in the
northern extratropics. In the numerical weather prediction models, the tropospheric
prediction skills are improved during the winters accompanying SSW events. For the
better prediction on the S2S timescale, the improved prediction of SSW events should be
needed during the winter.
